Success rate
    The rate at which your configurations pass the evaluation that is conducted. Note: The number of evaluations conducted does not always match the number of billable evaluations, as there is no charge for assessments evaluated as unable to perform. Be sure to look for the billable evaluations in each scan result if you need to estimate your cost.
Total controls
    The total number of controls that have been evaluated in the past 30 days.
Total evaluations
    The total number of evaluations that have been run in the past 30 days. An evaluation is the check of one resource against one assessment.  -->
