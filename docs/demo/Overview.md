Do not continue to the next steps until your IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) reservation for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) environment is in the **Ready** state, you have accepted the invitation to join the {{itz.CloudAccount}} ITZ account, and you have switched to the {{itz.CloudAccount}} in the IBM Cloud Portal.

This guide presents step-by-step directions for delivering three SCC demonstrations:
    
    - High-level demonstration of SCC
      This flow provides and executive level overview of SCC and how it provides security and compliance management.      

    - Remediating a failed compliance control
      This flow is more technical and illustrates how to create profiles and attachments and how to remediate a failed control.    
    
    - Demonstration of Workload Protection (WP)
      This flow provides an overview of WP and its integration with SCC and explores how WP can be used for compliance management of cloud native environments like IBM Kubernetes Service.


While all sellers are encouraged perform all three demonstrations, the requirements for completing the SCC Level 3 learning plan varies by roles. IBM Sales must record a stand and deliver that at a minimum covers the high-level demonstration of SCC flow. IBM Technical Sales must record a stand and deliver that covers at a minimum the high-level demonstration of SCC flow and at least one of the other two flows. Both Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales must pass a short quiz related to the scenarios and environment utilized by these flows.

Included with each flow, are step-by-step instructions along with talking points that can be used when delivering a client demonstration. While this demonstration guide is general in nature and not specific to a single client or industry, consider customizing it to a client you are currently working with or plan to work with in the future. Do this by addressing either a client specific pain point or a specific industry regulation that SCC covers (e.g. financial services). Demonstrations should resonate with the individuals in the audience. It is important to know your audience and the roles they have within their company when preparing and delivering your demonstrations. The demonstration steps provided below may not resonate with all user roles. For instance, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) may not be concerned about how to provision and instance fo IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC), but members of the CRO's technical staff tasked with doing so will. Some individuals will be focused on the aspects of compliance related to their code development while others will be focus on the infrastructure the applications run on in production. When planning a client demonstration focus on the most important aspects of the offering to the audience in attendance and be selective on the aspects of the SCC suite of offerings you choose to show.

Additionally, a recording is available for each of the flows. These videos may vary slightly from the documented flows, but they were all recorded using the same ITZ environment which you reserved earlier. To avoid charges to your IBM Cloud account, make sure you switch accounts in the IBM Cloud portal as described earlier.

!!! Warning 

    **Several parts of the demonstration script have you stop before clicking a "create" or "submit" button. This "baking-show" approach to demonstrating SCC is used to allow all participants in this learning plan to use the same environment, minimize cost, and avoid lengthy provisioning times of resources. If you do click "create" or "submit" you will receive an error stating you do not have permissions to perform that action.**

Proceed to the next chapter to perform the high-level demonstration of SCC.
