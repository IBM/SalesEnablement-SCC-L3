Do not continue to the next steps until your IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) reservation for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) environment is in the **Ready** state. 

# Access the ITZ environment
1. Open a web browser to the **IBM Cloud Portal**.

<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Portal</a>.

When the page loads, authenticate with your IBM Cloud ID and password. The authentication process varies depending on the primary account that your ID is associated with and any multi-factor authentication or other security controls in place for the account.

2. Click the **Notifications** (![](_attachments/notificationIcon.png)) icon.

3. Click the **Join now** link on the **Action required: You are invited to join an account in IBM Cloud** notification.

Note: if you do not see a notification like this, then, in most cases, your ITZ reservation is not in the **Ready** state. Wait for the reservation to become **Ready**. You will also receive an email with the **Join now** link.

4. Click the **I accept the product...** checkbox.
5. Click **Join Account**.

Note, if the browser window is narrow, you might see an **account selection** icon like this: ![](_attachments/switchAccountIcon.png) instead of the full account name.

Now that the reservation is active, the invitation to join the account has been accepted, and you have switched to the ITZ account with the pre-provisioned SCC instance, you are ready to proceed to the next chapters to configure the environment in preparation of performing a demonstration.
