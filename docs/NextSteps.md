REFER BACK TO SCC PATTERN FOR ADDITIONAL USE CASES. WE DIDN'T COVER MULTI-CLOUD IN THIS DEMO, BUT IT IS A KEY CAPABILITY OF THE OFFERING AND COULD BE DEMOED USING THE DEMOS DESCRIBED IN THE PATTERN.

Remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan:

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan when preparing the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-thru demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.
