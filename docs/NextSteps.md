TBW - REFER BACK TO SCC PATTERN FOR ADDITIONAL USE CASES. WE DIDN'T COVER MULTI-CLOUD IN THIS DEMO, BUT IT IS A KEY CAPABILITY OF THE OFFERING AND COULD BE DEMOED USING THE DEMOS DESCRIBED IN THE PATTERN.

Remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan:

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan when preparing the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and click-thru demonstrations, and not one's general knowledge of the offerings.

Use the links below to return to YourLearning (IBMers) or learn.ibm.com (business partners). Be sure and mark the Demonstration Guide activity complete.
