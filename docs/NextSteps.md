This demonstration guide only touched on part of the SCC capabilities. As mentioned in the Welcome section, another excellent resource is the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/IBM-Cloud-Satellite-and-PaaS-Community/technology-pattern-scc/" target="_blank">IBM Technology Patterns for Regulated Cloud workloads</a>. Be sure to check it out!

Remember to complete the {{learningplan.Name}} learning plan:

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate {{offering.Name}} to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation checklist in the learning plan when preparing the Stand and Deliver.

- Sales: <a href="{{learningplan.YLurlSales}}" target="_blank">{{learningplan.YLurlSales}}</a>

- Technical Sales: <a href="{{learningplan.YLurlTechSales}}" target="_blank">{{learningplan.YLurlTechSales}}</a>

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the {{learningplan.Name}} quiz from learn.ibm.com. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment, and not one's general knowledge of the offering. You are strongly encouraged to use the ITZ environment while taking your quiz.
