PROTECT WORKLOADS, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT, ASSESS 3RD & 4TH PARTY RISK,). WILL NOT HAVE HYBRID MULTI-CLOUD STRATEGY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, BUT CAN BE MENTIONED IN WP SECTION. Every good client demonstration should tell a story the client can relate to. This may be a particular pain point the client is experiencing or a common industry scenario. SCC includes both industry specific (e.g. Financial Services), cross industry controls, and the ability to build custom controls. When performing an actual client demonstration, sellers should focus on the controls most relevant to the client. Refer to the afore mentioned technology pattern for more information on SCC use cases. Additionally, if you know what IBM Cloud resources the client is already using, validate if those resources can be evaluated by SCC. Find the current list of resources that can be evaluated by SCC here . In addition to the Level 2 training and the Technology Pattern, all sellers and technical sellers are encouraged to read the SCC documentation . The documentation contains a wealth of information that is not covered in the Level 2 or Level 3 training including topics like: SCC's underlying architecture. Did you know SCC is a multi-tenant solution? High availability (HA) and disaster recover (DR) Protecting SCC resources with context-based restrictions Key SCC Concepts Before continuing review the following key concepts associated with SCC. Additional details on these and other SCC-related concepts can be found here . Control - A technical, administrative, or physical safeguard that is designed to meet a set of defined security and privacy requirements. Controls exist to prevent, detect, or lessen the ability of a threat to exploit a vulnerability. Specification - A statement that defines the specific security and privacy requirements that a control must meet. Control Library - A collection of predefined or custom controls. Control libraries show all the controls in an account that are available to be evaluated. A library is helpful for organizing and versioning controls. Profile - A group of controls that are related to a specific compliance objective. Although very similar in structure to a control library, a profile can be attached to a set of resources and be evaluated. Assessment - The actual evaluation of a configuration for compliance with applicable standards. An assessment can be either automated or manual depending on the control. Rule - A set of conditional statements that are used to determine whether a resource configuration is in compliance. To evaluate a rule, it must be associated with a profile through an assessment. Parameter - The specific configuration property that is evaluated. Each parameter is assigned a value by default that can be customized when an attachment is created. For example, if a control evaluates which region that a resource exits in, you can specify the region that you want to check for by defining the parameter. Attachment - The connection between a profile and scope that defines the way that SCC conducts an evaluation. An attachment is formed by selecting the grouping of resources to be evaluates and a profile. Then, you specify the parameters that you want to evaluate for. Attachments are evaluated once per day or can be initiated as needed. These concepts can be visualized in these steps: A security or compliance focal specifies the controls to be enabled. This is done by selecting a pre-defined profile (e.g. IBM Cloud Security Best Practices, IBM Cloud for Financial Services, etc.) or creating a custom profile with specific controls. Optionally, the focal could create custom rules. Next, the focal creates an attachment of the profile. The attachment defines the scope of resources to be scanned along with any optional, customized parameters for specific controls. Once saved, the initial scan of the attachment is performed against the scoped resources. Scan's are typically done on a daily basis, weekly, or monthly basis, but can also be run ad-hoc. The results of the scan or stored in a IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) specified by the client when the SCC instance is created. And finally, the results are made accessible through the SCC Dashboard in the IBM Cloud Portal. In the next sections of this demonstration guide learn how to demonstration SCC to clients using the flow above along with sample talking points and a few additional demonstration ideas that may be relevant to specific client audiences.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#ibm-cloud-security-and-compliance-center-level-3-demonstration-guide","text":"Welcome to the demonstration guide for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Level 3 learning plan.

This guide presents step-by-step directions for delivering three SCC demonstrations: - High-level demonstration of SCC This flow provides and executive level overview of SCC and how it provides security and compliance management. - Remediating a failed compliance control This flow is more technical and illustrates how to create profiles and attachments and how to remediate a failed control. - Demonstration of Workload Protection (WP) This flow provides an overview of WP and its integration with SCC and explores how WP can be used for compliance management of cloud native environments like IBM Kubernetes Service. While all sellers are encouraged perform all three demonstrations, the requirements for completing the SCC Level 3 learning plan varies by roles. IBM Sales must record a stand and deliver that at a minimum covers the high-level demonstration of SCC flow. IBM Technical Sales must record a stand and deliver that covers at a minimum the high-level demonstration of SCC flow and at least one of the other two flows. Both Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales must pass a short quiz related to the scenarios and environment utilized by these flows. Included with each flow, are step-by-step instructions along with talking points that can be used when delivering a client demonstration. While this demonstration guide is general in nature and not specific to a single client or industry, consider customizing it to a client you are currently working with or plan to work with in the future. Do this by addressing either a client specific pain point or a specific industry regulation that SCC covers (e.g. financial services). Demonstrations should resonate with the individuals in the audience. It is important to know your audience and the roles they have within their company when preparing and delivering your demonstrations. The demonstration steps provided below may not resonate with all user roles. For instance, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) may not be concerned about how to provision and instance fo IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC), but members of the CRO's technical staff tasked with doing so will. Some individuals will be focused on the aspects of compliance related to their code development while others will be focus on the infrastructure the applications run on in production. When planning a client demonstration focus on the most important aspects of the offering to the audience in attendance and be selective on the aspects of the SCC suite of offerings you choose to show. Additionally, a recording is available for each of the flows. These videos may vary slightly from the documented flows, but they were all recorded using the same ITZ environment which you reserved earlier. To avoid charges to your IBM Cloud account, make sure you switch accounts in the IBM Cloud portal as described earlier. Warning Several parts of the demonstration script have you stop before clicking a \"create\" or \"submit\" button. This \"baking-show\" approach to demonstrating SCC is used to allow all participants in this learning plan to use the same environment, minimize cost, and avoid lengthy provisioning times of resources. If you do click \"create\" or \"submit\" you will receive an error stating you do not have permissions to perform that action.

Note: a support ticket has been opened asking this information be moved to a main section of the SCC documentation. In general, this is not an issue when deployed in a production environment, however it does cause some challenges when demonstrating how the results change when a detected compliance issue is remediated.

Click the Standard pricing plan. Discussion points: SCC provides a trial pricing plan, which allows clients to try SCC at no cost for 30 days. The standard pricing plan is based upon the number of evaluations performed. Clients are charged if an evaluation produces a result of pass or fail. Charges are not incurred for the evaluation if the check cannot be performed or is not applicable. Each scan that is run provides with the number of billable evaluations in the results user interface (UI). More information on SCC pricing can be found here . IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) has a different pricing model. WP is priced hourly based on the number of nodes protected. More information about WP pricing can be found here . Click the I have read and agree to the following license agreements checkbox. Discussion points: That is all the information required to create an SCC instance. You could discuss the use of resource groups, tags, and access management tags which are used to organize and control access cloud resources.

In this demonstration guide, you will demonstrate how to remediate a failed compliance scan related to internet protocol (IP) address spoofing on a virtual server instance (VSI) running in an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). While IP address spoofing has legitimate business uses, it is also a potential vulnerability. Learn more about IP address spoofing here . SCC has a predefined control that checks to see if a VSI in a VPC has IP address spoofing enabled and flags those VSI's as non-compliant. This scenario was chosen as it is easy to turn enable and disable this setting on a VSI and VSI's in VPC are inexpensive resources which provision very quickly. In the next steps: provision a VSI instance with IP network spoofing enabled create a SCC attachment that scans for VSIs with IP network spoofing enabled run an initial scan In the Client Demonstration section, you will show the client the compliance failure related to the VSI you created, remediate the issue, re-run the scan, and show the new, successful compliance results.

Your VSI name will be the first part of your IBM Cloud user ID (typically email address) followed by a random number and -scc-vsi . For example: andrew-14294-scc-vsi Verify the VSI was created with IP spoofing enabled Return to the IBM Cloud browser window/tab. Click the VPC Infrastructure icon ( ) in the menu bar. Click the Virtual server instances option in the left-hand menu. Click your VSI's name in the table. Scroll down to the Network interfaces section and verify Allow IP spoofing is enabled. Create a SCC attachment and run an initial scan In the steps that follow, using a pre-provisioned instance of SCC, you will create an attachment which will scan for VSI on VPCs in a single IBM Cloud resource group to see if IP network spoofing is enabled. When the attachment is saved, the first scan will automatically be performed. Recall in the scenario described earlier, we will show the failed compliance check (IP spoofing is disabled for all VSIs in VPCs), remediate the issue, and then re-scan to show the compliance check is successful. It is important to understand that SCC cache's scan results for one hour. This means if you run the same scan within an hour of the last time the scan was run, a new scan is NOT performed and the old results are returned. This will be important to remember when performing a client demonstration or if you a recording your Stand and Deliver. In the Client Demonstration section of this guide, you demonstrate how to view the scan results, remediate the issue, re-run the scan, and view the new results and the \"drift\" in compliance between the scans. Additional, commentary will be provided in that section of the guide. For now simply follow the next steps to create the attachment and have the first scan execute. Navigate to the SCC Dashboard page in the IBM Cloud portal. Click Attachments in the left-hand menu. Click Create + . Enter a unique Name for your attachment and then click Next . Attachment names need to be unique. To avoid issues, it is suggested that you use a name similar to the VSI created earlier, for example: andrew-14294-ipspoofing-compliance . Select se-scc-l3-DO-NOT-DELETE in the Profile pull-down menu and then click Next You will examine the se-scc-l3-DO-NOT-DELETE profile in detail in the next section of the guide. Select SCC-L3 in the Scope pull-down menu and click Next . You will learn more about the Scope setting in the next section of the guide. Review the details on the Scan settings page and click Next . For now, the default settings are fine, and will be explain in more details in the next section of the guide. Review all the attachment settings and click Create . The attachment is now saved and the initial scan is being run. Notice the Scan in progress message for your attachment. Due to a user interface issue with this page (at least some browsers), this progress message will remain on the screen until you refresh the page. As this is a very simple scan of one control on a very limited scope, this scan only takes a minute or two to run. Wait a couple of minutes and then click the browser's refresh button and the Next scan information should be shown.

When the attachment is saved, the first scan will automatically be performed. Recall in the scenario described earlier, we will show the failed compliance check (IP spoofing is disabled for all VSIs in VPCs), remediate the issue, and then re-scan to show the compliance check is successful. It is important to understand that SCC cache's scan results for one hour. This means if you run the same scan within an hour of the last time the scan was run, a new scan is NOT performed and the old results are returned. This will be important to remember when performing a client demonstration or if you a recording your Stand and Deliver. In the Client Demonstration section of this guide, you demonstrate how to view the scan results, remediate the issue, re-run the scan, and view the new results and the \"drift\" in compliance between the scans. Additional, commentary will be provided in that section of the guide. For now simply follow the next steps to create the attachment and have the first scan execute. Navigate to the SCC Dashboard page in the IBM Cloud portal. Click Attachments in the left-hand menu. Click Create + . Enter a unique Name for your attachment and then click Next . Attachment names need to be unique. To avoid issues, it is suggested that you use a name similar to the VSI created earlier, for example: andrew-14294-ipspoofing-compliance . Select se-scc-l3-DO-NOT-DELETE in the Profile pull-down menu and then click Next You will examine the se-scc-l3-DO-NOT-DELETE profile in detail in the next section of the guide. Select SCC-L3 in the Scope pull-down menu and click Next . You will learn more about the Scope setting in the next section of the guide. Review the details on the Scan settings page and click Next . For now, the default settings are fine, and will be explain in more details in the next section of the guide. Review all the attachment settings and click Create . The attachment is now saved and the initial scan is being run. Notice the Scan in progress message for your attachment. Due to a user interface issue with this page (at least some browsers), this progress message will remain on the screen until you refresh the page. As this is a very simple scan of one control on a very limited scope, this scan only takes a minute or two to run. Wait a couple of minutes and then click the browser's refresh button and the Next scan information should be shown. At this point, you can proceed to the next chapter to learn about and configure IBM Cloud Event Notifications to enhance your client demonstration or continue to the next section to perform a client demonstration. While enabling IBM Cloud Event Notifications is optional, you are encouraged to at least read the introduction to learn more about IBM Cloud Event Notifications.","title":"Create a SCC attachment and run an initial scan"},{"location":"env/ConfigureSMS/","text":"This is an optional task for the Level 3 learning plan requirements. SCC can integrate with IBM Cloud Event Notifications which is used to send notifications to users via e-mail, SMS, or other supported notification channels (recall the Notify me toggle in the Scan settings page of when creating an attachment). The ITZ environment for this demonstration guide is enabled with IBM Cloud Event Notifications. Step-by-step instructions for enabling SMS notifications to your personal mobile device are provided below. To learn about provisioning IBM Cloud Event Notifications and configuration SCC to use it, read the documentation here . Follow these steps to add SMS notifications as part of your demonstration. Click the Settings option in the left-hand menu of the Security and Compliance page. Click the eventnotifications-scc-l3 link under Event Notifications . Don't worry about the Missing authorization message in the Storage section. In this ITZ environment, your ID does not have permissions to view this information. Rest assured that the environment is properly configured. A new browser window or tab will be opened. Click Subscriptions in left-hand menu. Click the three ellipses icon ( ) for the SCC-l3-subscription entry in the table and then click Edit . Enter your SMS enabled mobile device number in the Phone numbers dialog, and then click the Add + button in the Recipients section of the Subscription details dialog. The mobile device number you enter must be in the proper format. Numbers should being with + and country code. Use the Learn more link in the dialog if you are unsure of the proper format. Do not change anything else on this page The IAM permissions required to add mobile device numbers to a subscription also allow users to modify the subscription topic and name. Please do not change these values as this will negatively affect other IBM and Business Partner sellers using this demonstration environment. Click Save . Shortly after saving the subscription, a SMS message should be received on your mobile device. You must click the link provided to continue to receive the SMS message notifications. You can unsubscribe at anytime. Click the verification link in the SMS message on your mobile device. Note, the above image was taken from a Apple iPhone. It may look different on other mobile devices. A new browser window or tab will open on your mobile device. Click Confirm . Upon receiving the Successfully Subscribed message, close the window on your mobile device. Return to the Event Notification's Subscriptions browser window and close it. Note, at this point the scan you created earlier is not enabled to send notifications. You will update this setting in the next section of the guide.

To access the instance, you will need to create a reservation an IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment dedicated to this learning plan. There are several advantages of leveraging a pre-provisioned SCC instance including being able to see historical SCC scans of resources that would not be available if a new instance was provisioned. Additionally, since all users of this learning plan utilize the same environment there is a cost savings to IBM. This is a shared environment, and you will have limited access to creating resources. Since this is a shared environment, your IBM Cloud identification (ID) will have limited access. For instance, you will not be able to provision a new SCC instance, but you will be able to create rules and attachments, initiate scans, view the SCC dashboard, etc. Attempts to perform actions you do not have permissions for will result in an error like: Please remember to delete any resources you provision as part of this learning plan!
