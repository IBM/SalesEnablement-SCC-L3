In this Level 3 course, learn how to demonstrate IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) and IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) to clients. ACCREDITATION To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various sections of this demonstration guide. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. IBMers must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recording is provided within the Evaluation Checklist that accompanies the Level 3 course in YourLearning. Before starting this learning plan, it is highly recommended that you complete the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Foundation learning plan as that base knowledge is assumed for this course. The Level 2 courses can be found here: IBMers: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-7D82EAEDC78C Business Partners: https://learn.ibm.com/course Another excellent resource is the IBM Technology Patterns for Regulated Cloud workloads . This website includes use cases, client stories, and other seller enablement. The site also includes more assets for demos and labs that are related to SCC. These assets include reservable IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environments. These environments are excellent options for proof-of-concepts, and the like, for custom client engagements. This environment differs from the environment that is used for this learning plan. The ITZ environment for this learning plan utilizes pre-provisioned resources in a shared environment allowing sellers and technical sellers to quickly have access to a demonstration environment without the need for time-consuming provisioning and configuration tasks. Every good client demonstration should tell a story that the client can relate to. This can be a particular pain point the client is experiencing or a common industry scenario. SCC includes both industry specific (for example Financial Services), cross-industry controls, and the ability to build custom controls. When performing an actual client demonstration, sellers should focus on the controls most relevant to the client. Refer to the previously mentioned technology pattern for more information on SCC use cases. Additionally, if you know what IBM Cloud resources the client is already using, validate if those resources can be evaluated by SCC. Find the current list of resources that can be evaluated by SCC here . In addition to the Level 2 training and the Technology Pattern, all sellers and technical sellers are encouraged to read the SCC documentation . The documentation contains a wealth of information that is not covered in the Level 2 or Level 3 training, including topics like: SCC's underlying architecture. Did you know that SCC is a multi-tenant solution? High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) Protecting SCC resources with context-based restrictions Key SCC Concepts Before continuing, review the following key concepts associated with SCC. Additional details on these and other SCC-related concepts can be found here . Control - A technical, administrative, or physical safeguard that is designed to meet a set of defined security and privacy requirements. Controls exist to prevent, detect, or lessen the ability of a threat to exploit a vulnerability. Specification - A statement that defines the specific security and privacy requirements that a control must meet. Control Library - A collection of predefined or custom controls. Control libraries show all the controls in an account that are available to be evaluated. A library is helpful for organizing and versioning controls. Profile - A group of controls that are related to a specific compliance objective. Although very similar in structure to a control library, a profile can be attached to a set of resources and be evaluated. Assessment - The actual evaluation of a configuration for compliance with applicable standards. An assessment can be either automated or manual depending on the control. Rule - A set of conditional statements that are used to determine whether a resource configuration is in compliance. To evaluate a rule, it must be associated with a profile through an assessment. Parameter - The specific configuration property that is evaluated. Each parameter is assigned a value by default that can be customized when an attachment is created. For example, if a control evaluates which region that a resource exits in, you can specify the region that you want to check for by defining the parameter. Attachment - The connection between a profile and scope that defines the way that SCC conducts an evaluation. An attachment is formed by selecting the grouping of resources to be evaluates and a profile. Then, you specify the parameters that you want to evaluate for. Attachments are evaluated once per day or can be initiated as needed. These concepts can be visualized in these steps: A security or compliance focal specifies the controls to be enabled. This is done by selecting a pre-defined profile (for example IBM Cloud Security Best Practices, IBM Cloud for Financial Services, and so on) or creating a custom profile with specific controls. Optionally, the focal might create custom rules. Next, the focal creates an attachment of the profile. The attachment defines the scope of resources to be scanned along with any optional, customized parameters for specific controls. Once saved, the initial scan of the attachment is performed against the scoped resources. Scan's are typically done daily, weekly, or monthly basis, but can also be run ad-hoc. The results of the scan or stored in a IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) specified by the client when the SCC instance is created. Finally, the results are made accessible through the SCC Dashboard in the IBM Cloud Portal. In the next sections of this demonstration guide, learn how to demonstrate SCC to clients using the flow above along with sample talking points and additional demonstration ideas that might be relevant to specific client audiences.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#ibm-cloud-security-and-compliance-center-level-3-demonstration-guide","text":"Welcome to the demonstration guide for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) Level 3 learning plan.

This guide presents step-by-step directions for delivering four SCC demonstrations: Provisioning an SCC instance This flow shows how to provision an SCC instance using the IBM Cloud Portal. High-level demonstration of SCC This flow provides and executive level overview of SCC and how it provides security and compliance management. Remediating a failed control This flow is more technical and illustrates how to create profiles and attachments and how to remediate a failed control. Demonstration of Workload Protection (WP) This flow provides an overview of WP and its integration with SCC and explores how WP can be used for compliance management of cloud native environments like IBM Kubernetes Service. While all sellers are encouraged perform all three demonstrations, the requirements for completing the SCC Level 3 learning plan varies by roles. IBM Sales must record a stand and deliver that at a minimum covers the high-level demonstration of SCC flow. IBM Technical Sales must record a stand and deliver that covers at a minimum the high-level demonstration of SCC flow and at least one of the other two flows. Both Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales must pass a short quiz related to the scenarios and environment utilized by these flows. Included with each flow, are step-by-step instructions along with talking points that can be used when delivering a client demonstration. While this demonstration guide is general in nature and not specific to a single client or industry, consider customizing it to a client you are currently working with or plan to work with in the future. Do this by addressing either a client specific pain point or a specific industry regulation that SCC covers (e.g. financial services). Demonstrations should resonate with the individuals in the audience. It is important to know your audience and the roles they have within their company when preparing and delivering your demonstrations. The demonstration steps provided below may not resonate with all user roles. For instance, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) may not be concerned about how to provision and instance fo IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC), but members of the CRO's technical staff tasked with doing so will. Some individuals will be focused on the aspects of compliance related to their code development while others will be focus on the infrastructure the applications run on in production. When planning a client demonstration focus on the most important aspects of the offering to the audience in attendance and be selective on the aspects of the SCC suite of offerings you choose to show. Additionally, a recording is available for each of the flows. These videos may vary slightly from the documented flows, but they were all recorded using the same ITZ environment which you reserved earlier. To avoid charges to your IBM Cloud account, make sure you switch accounts in the IBM Cloud portal as described earlier. Warning Several parts of the demonstration script have you stop before clicking a \"create\" or \"submit\" button. This \"baking-show\" approach to demonstrating SCC is used to allow all participants in this learning plan to use the same environment, minimize cost, and avoid lengthy provisioning times of resources. If you do click \"create\" or \"submit\" you will receive an error stating you do not have permissions to perform that action.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"demo/provisioning/","text":"In this demonstration flow, you will be using a baking show approach to show how an IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) instance and related resources are provisioned. You will not be provisioning these resources, rather you will utilize pre-provisioned resources. As mentioned earlier, this scenario may be of interest to only a few individuals in the client's organization and may be skipped if not demonstrating to the technical team that will be responsible for deploying SCC. Open a web browser to the IBM Cloud Portal . IBM Cloud Portal . When the page loads, authenticate with your IBM Cloud ID and password. The authentication process varies depending on the primary account that your ID is associated with and any multi-factor authentication or other security controls in place for the account. Click the account selection drop-down menu and select the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account. Note, if the browser window is narrow, you might see an account selection icon like this: instead of the full account name. Click the Security and Compliance icon ( ) in the menu bar. Click Create instance+ . Click the Select a location drop-down menu. Discussion points: SCC instances are specific to IBM Cloud regions. As shown in the portal, SCC is currently available in three regions. Look for additional regions to be added in the future based upon client demands. Select the Dallas (us-south) location. Click the Standard pricing plan. Discussion points: SCC provides a trial pricing plan, which allows clients to try SCC at no cost for 30 days. The standard pricing plan is based upon the number of evaluations performed. Clients are charged if an evaluation produces a result of pass or fail. Charges are not incurred for the evaluation if the check cannot be performed or is not applicable. Each scan that is run provides with the number of billable evaluations in the results user interface (UI). More information on SCC pricing can be found here . IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) has a different pricing model. WP is priced hourly based on the number of nodes protected. More information about WP pricing can be found here . Click the I have read and agree to the following license agreements checkbox. Discussion points: That is all the information required to create an SCC instance. You could discuss the use of resource groups, tags, and access management tags which are used to organize and control access cloud resources. Provisioning the instances typically takes under a couple of minutes. Inform your audience that you will now switch to an existing SCC instance. Click the browser's back button to return to the Security and Compliance overview page. If you click Create in the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account, you will receive an error. SCC configuration and integration phase Before using SCC, a few additional steps need to be performed. First, a IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket needs to be assigned to the SCC instance. COS is used to store the results of scans performed by SCC. The process of provisioning COS and assigning a bucket to SCC is not covered in this guide. To learn more about the process, consult the documentation here . Workload Protection (WP) is a core part of the SCC suite but is provisioned and configured separately. This integration is already done in this ITZ environment and will be part of the demonstration steps that follow.

This flow tells the story of remediating a compliance failure and viewing the improved results in IBM Security and Compliance Center (SCC). Before proceeding to this step, make sure at least one (1) full hour passed since you initially created your custom attachment. It is important to understand that SCC cache's scan results for one hour. This means if you run the same scan within an hour of the last time the scan was run, a new scan is NOT performed and the old results are returned. This is important to remember when performing a client demonstration or if you are recording your Stand and Deliver. Open a web browser to the IBM Cloud Portal . IBM Cloud Portal .

Note, if the browser window is narrow, you might see an account selection icon like this: instead of the full account name. Click the Security and Compliance icon ( ) in the menu bar. Click Attachments in the left menu. Click the ellipses icon ( ) of the Attachment that you created earlier and then click View scan results . In this example, andrew-14294-ipspoofing-compliance . Click the link for the last scan run. Describe to the audience the simplified attachment that you created earlier that has a single control that is being evaluated and that the control failed. Note, the success rate percentage will likely be different in the IBM Portal than shown here. Click the Controls tab. Describe how this custom profile was created by using a single control from one of the pre-defined profiles. In this case, the control is the check to see whether IP spoofing is enabled for any VSIs in VPCs. Click the Resources tab and then the down arrow icon ( ) next to the VSI that you created earlier. Describe how the table shows the VSIs that are not in compliance. Now, it is time to remediate the issue for at one of the VSIs. Note: your view of resources that have failed will vary based upon others using the environment. Click the hamburger menu icon ( ) and then click the VPC icon. Click Virtual server instances under the Compute heading in the left menu. Click the name of the VSI that you created earlier. In this example, andrew-14294-scc-vsi . Scroll down to the Network interfaces section. Note: your view of VSI resources will vary based on others using the environment. Show the audience that the current networking setting for this VSI has IP spoofing enabled and that to fix the compliance issue, it needs to be disabled. Click the pencil icon ( ) to edit the network interface settings. Click the Allow IP spoofing toggle to change the setting from Enabled to Disabled and click Save . The issue is remediated, so it is time to rerun the scan. Click the hamburger menu icon ( ) and then click the Security and Compliance option. Click Attachments in the left menu. Click the ellipses icon ( ) of the Attachment that you created earlier and then click Run scan . In this example, andrew-14294-ipspoofing-compliance . Click Run scan in the Scan now popup window. The Scan in progress message appears for the attachment.

It introduces the key concepts of controls, profiles, and attachments and illustrates how to use the SCC Dashboard and review SCC scan results. Open a web browser to the IBM Cloud Portal . IBM Cloud Portal . When the page loads, authenticate with your IBM Cloud ID and password. The authentication process varies depending on the primary account that your ID is associated with and any multi-factor authentication or other security controls in place for the account. Click the account selection drop-down menu and select the 2305900 - ITZ - ADHOC03 account. Note, if the browser window is narrow, you might see an account selection icon like this: instead of the full account name. Click the Security and Compliance icon ( ) in the menu bar. The SCC overview page in the IBM Cloud Portal provides a good starting point for demonstrations. Introduce SCC in an impactful way that resonates with the audience. For example, discuss recent news stories that are related to the client's main industry and compliance failures. Describe the benefits of SCC, for example, SCC helps protect organizations from financial and civil penalities by identifying misconfigurations and addressing compliance issues both on premises and in the cloud. SCC does this by conducting scans of the client's environment. To run a scan, an attachment must first be created. Click the Get started button. Enter testscan in the Name field and click Next Click the Profile pull-down. Scroll through the pre-defined profiles that are provided by SCC and describe the most relevant profiles to the client. For example, if the client is in the financial industry, spend some time describing the IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile that is developed and maintained by IBM and leading financial institutions. To learn more about the pre-defined profiles, visit the product documentation here . Note, the acronym CIS stands for Center for Internet Security : https://www.cisecurity.org . The CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark is the product of a community consensus process and consists of secure configurations guidelines that are developed for IBM Cloud. You can learn more about the benchmark here . Select the CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark profile or one of the other pre-defined ones if more appropriate for your client. Describe how profiles are composed of a set off controls , which specify the specifications and rules for evaluating the configuration of affected resources. Expand one of the controls and describe the compliance check that this control performs. Click the down arrow ( ) next to the Check whether Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is configured with at least TLS v1.2 for all inbound traffic. and then click the JSON tab. Each control has one or more specifications, in this case \"Check whether Cloud Internet Services (CIS) is configured with at least TLS v1.2 for all inbound traffic\" and rules that check for the desired state against a resource. Click the Parameters tab to see the default parameters used in the rule. Click Next . Click the Scope pull-down menu. The scope defines which resources will be evaluated against the controls in the profile. Describe how scan's can be scoped to an account or a resource group. IBM Cloud enterprise accounts have further capabilities to scope at the subaccount or account groups. Click SCC-L3 and then click Next**. Click Next on the Scan settings page. The scan settings page allows you to enable or disable the scan, set the schedule for the scan, and enable notifications. We cover Notifications in a later demonstration flow. Review the attachment settings. Described that the time to take to run a scan depends on the number of controls that are specified and the scope that defines what resources are to be scanned. Given a scan against the IAM Cloud Security Best Practices take several minutes, let the audience know that you are switching to an attachment created earlier with the same parameters. Click Cancel and then click Cancel on the confirmation dialog that pops up. Click Attachments in the left menu. Highlight the attachment named SCC-L3-CIS - DO NOT DELETE . This attachment scans for the compliance controls specified in the IBM Cloud Security Best Practices profile. Click the ellipses icon ( ) for the SCC-L3-attachment - DO NOT DELETE entry and then click View scan results . Click the most recent (top of list) scan results in the table. The overview page shows the results of the scan that was run. Use the following definitions to describe the results to the audience. Success rate - The rate at which configurations pass the evaluation that is conducted. Note: The number of evaluations conducted does not always match the number of billable evaluations, as there is no charge for assessments evaluated as unable to perform. Evaluation - assessment of a specific control to a specific resource. Assessment - The actual evaluation of a configuration for compliance with applicable standards. An assessment can be either automated or manual depending on the control. Click the Timeframe pull-down menu for the Drift graphic and select a timeframe to best visualize drift. This scan was originally set up on August 13, 2023. After the original scan, several remediation steps were taken to resolve some of the noncompliant checks. To best show the drift in compliance select the shortest time frame that brings August 13, 2023 into view. For example, select 3 months if you are running before the end of October 2023, otherwise select 6 months or 1 year. Describe how the Drift view provides a nice visual for the compliance status of the environment over a time. It is easy to see where improvements were made and perhaps where some compliance ground was lost. The bottom table shows individual resources that failed an evaluation. Click the down arrow icon ( ) next to the iam-identity resource in the table. This view shows all the evaluations that passed and failed for a particular resource, in this case Identity and Access Management (IAM). From here, remediation can begin to improve compliance posture. Click the Controls tab and then click Non-compliant in the Evaluation drop-down menu in the table. There are various views (by Control, by Resource, and so on) and filters that can be applied to the output to visualize where issues are in the environment's compliance posture. This is a starting point in understanding where to focus effort in terms of implementing security and compliance measures to remediate potential vulnerabilities. The steps that follow go into more detail regarding controls, control libraries, and profiles. Click the Dashboard link at the top of the page. Click the Controls option and then Control libraries in the left menu. Here we see the current control libraries that are provided by SCC. These controls and control libraries are maintained by IBM and are updated regularly. The IBM Cloud for Financial Services control library has over 500 controls that are defined by IBM and industry-leading companies that are part of our Financial Services Advisory Council. We also have control libraries specific to cloud native applications and control libraries specific to cloud native applications on other clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google. Note: the next steps use the CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark, but feel free to select a control library that best aligns with your client. Click CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark . Let\u2019s look at the CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark library again. Here we see the all the assessments that make up the library that is grouped by control, and we can view them grouped by component. Click the Grouped by component tab. Click the Security and Compliance link at the top of the page. Click Profiles in the left menu. Recall when creating an attachment, a \u201cprofile\u201d was specified and not a control library. Let\u2019s look at profiles next. SCC supports both pre-defined and custom profiles. The pre-defined profiles are, for the most part, aligned with a control library. Click Create + . Enter test in the Name field and test in the Description field and then click Next A version control system is available for profiles and control libraries to support updates and changes to controls and standards. Click Add + on the Controls page. Since not all controls might apply to a client's requirements, you can create custom profile based on one of the existing libraries. Click CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark and then click Next . Click a couple of the checkboxes to select individual controls and then click Add . When building off an existing control library, clients can select just the controls that apply to their requirements. Click Next . Click Next . The profile can now be saved and used to create new attachments. Do not create additional profiles in the shared ITZ environment. Click Cancel and click Cancel on the confirmation pop-up dialog. While you have permission to save new profiles, to avoid additional cleanup work at the end of this learning plan, click cancel. In addition to creating custom profiles and custom control libraries, SCC supports the creation of custom rules. The topic of custom rules is not covered in this course, but you can find more information on the topic here and in the IBM Technology Patterns for Regulated Cloud workloads .

In this demonstration guide, demonstrate how to remediate a failed compliance scan that is related to internet protocol (IP) address spoofing on a virtual server instance (VSI) running in an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). While IP address spoofing has legitimate business uses, it is also a potential vulnerability. Learn more about IP address spoofing here . SCC has a predefined control that checks to see whether a VSI in a VPC has IP address spoofing enabled and flags those VSI's as noncompliant. This scenario was chosen as it is easy to enable and disable this setting on a VSI and VSI's in VPC are inexpensive resources which provision quickly. In the next steps: provision a VSI instance with IP network spoofing enabled create an SCC attachment that scans for VSIs with IP network spoofing enabled run an initial scan In the Client Demonstrations section, you will show the client the compliance failure that is related to the VSI you created, remediate the issue, rerun the scan, and show the new, successful compliance results.
