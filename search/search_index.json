In this Level 3 course, you will learn how to demonstrate IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) and IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) to clients. Before starting this learning plan, it is highly recommended that you complete the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Foundation learning plan as that base knowledge is assumed for this course. The Level 2 courses can be found here: IBMers: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-??? Business Partners: https://learn.ibm.com/course Another excellent resource is the IBM Technology Patterns for Regulated Cloud workloads . This web site includes use cases, client stories, and other seller enablement. The site also includes additional assets for demos and labs related to SCC. These assets include reservable IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environments. These environments are excellent options for proof-of-concepts and the like for individualized client engagements. This differs from the environment used for this learning plan. The ITZ environment for this learning plan utilizes pre-provisioned resources in a shared environment allowing sellers and technical sellers to very quickly have access to a demonstration environment without the need for time-consuming provisioning, configuration tasks, and, of course, to complete this Level 3 training. Every good client demonstration should tell a story the client can relate to. This may be a particular pain point the client is experiencing or a common industry scenario. SCC includes both industry specific (e.g. Financial Services), cross industry controls, and the ability to build custom controls. When performing an actual client demonstration, sellers should focus on the controls most relevant to the client. Refer to the afore mentioned technology pattern for more information on SCC use cases. Additionally, if you know what IBM Cloud resources the client is already using, validate if those resources can be evaluated by SCC. Find the current list of resources that can be evaluated by SCC here . In addition to the Level 2 training and the Technology Pattern, all sellers and technical sellers are encouraged to read the SCC documentation . The documentation contains a wealth of information that is not covered in the Level 2 or Level 3 training including topics like: SCC's underlying architecture. Did you know SCC is a multi-tenant solution? High availability (HA) and disaster recover (DR) Protecting SCC resources with context-based restrictions Key SCC Concepts Before continuing review the following key concepts associated with SCC. Additional details on these and other SCC-related concepts can be found here . Control - A technical, administrative, or physical safeguard that is designed to meet a set of defined security and privacy requirements. Controls exist to prevent, detect, or lessen the ability of a threat to exploit a vulnerability. Specification - A statement that defines the specific security and privacy requirements that a control must meet. Control Library - A collection of predefined or custom controls. Control libraries show all the controls in an account that are available to be evaluated. A library is helpful for organizing and versioning controls. Profile - A group of controls that are related to a specific compliance objective. Although very similar in structure to a control library, a profile can be attached to a set of resources and be evaluated. Assessment - The actual evaluation of a configuration for compliance with applicable standards. An assessment can be either automated or manual depending on the control. Rule - A set of conditional statements that are used to determine whether a resource configuration is in compliance. To evaluate a rule, it must be associated with a profile through an assessment. Parameter - The specific configuration property that is evaluated. Each parameter is assigned a value by default that can be customized when an attachment is created. For example, if a control evaluates which region that a resource exits in, you can specify the region that you want to check for by defining the parameter. Attachment - The connection between a profile and scope that defines the way that SCC conducts an evaluation. An attachment is formed by selecting the grouping of resources to be evaluates and a profile. Then, you specify the parameters that you want to evaluate for. Attachments are evaluated once per day or can be initiated as needed. These concepts can be visualized in these steps: A security or compliance focal specifies the controls to be enabled. This is done by selecting a pre-defined profile (e.g. IBM Cloud Security Best Practices, IBM Cloud for Financial Services, etc.) or creating a custom profile with specific controls. Optionally, the focal could create custom rules. Next, the focal creates an attachment of the profile. The attachment defines the scope of resources to be scanned along with any optional, customized parameters for specific controls. Once saved, the initial scan of the attachment is performed against the scoped resources. Scan's are typically done on a daily basis, weekly, or monthly basis, but can also be run ad-hoc. The results of the scan or stored in a IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) specified by the client when the SCC instance is created. And finally, the results are made accessible through the SCC Dashboard in the IBM Cloud Portal. In the next sections of this demonstration guide learn how to demonstration SCC to clients using the flow above along with sample talking points and a few additional demonstration ideas that may be relevant to specific client audiences.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#ibm-cloud-security-and-compliance-center-level-3-demonstration-guide","text":"Welcome to the demonstration guide for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Level 3 learning plan.

In the next chapter of the demonstration guide, step-by-step instructions are provided along with talking points that can be used when delivering a client demonstration of SCC. While this demonstration guide is general in nature and not specific to a single client or industry, consider customizing it to a client you are currently working with or plan to work with in the future. Do this by addressing either a client specific pain point or a specific industry regulation that SCC covers (e.g. financial services). Everything demonstrated in the next chapter can be accomplished using the ITZ environment provisioned earlier. To avoid charges to your IBM Cloud account, make sure you switch accounts in the IBM Cloud portal as described in the previous section. Several parts of the demonstration script have you stop before clicking a \"create\" or \"submit\" button. This \"baking-show\" approach to demonstrating SCC is used to allow all participants in this learning plan use the same environment, minimize cost, and avoid lengthy provisioning times of resources. In the demonstration flow that follows, these steps are prefaced with explore versus create or similar verbs. If you do click \"create\" or \"submit\" you will receive an error stating you do not have permissions to perform that action. One not very well documented \"feature\" of IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center is that the results of a scan are cached for an hour. If a second scan for an attachment is performed within the hour after another scan has completed, the 2nd scan is not performed and the results from the previous scan are used. Read more here . Note: a support ticket has been opened asking this information be moved to a main section of the SCC documentation. In general, this is not an issue when deployed in a production environment, however it does cause some challenges when demonstrating how the results change when a detected compliance issue is remediated.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"demo/Step-by-Step/","text":"Demonstrations should resonate with the audience. It is important to know your audience and the roles they have within their company when preparing and delivering your demonstrations. The demonstration steps provided below may not resonate with all user roles. For instance, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) may not be concerned about how to provision and instance fo IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC), but members of the CRO's technical staff tasked with doing so will. Some individuals will be focused on the aspects of compliance related to their code development while others will be focus on the infrastructure the applications run on in production. When planning a client demonstration focus on the most important aspects of the offering to the audience in attendance and be selective on the aspects of the SCC suite of offerings you choose to show. Explore provisioning an SCC instance In this phase of the demo, you will be using a baking show approach to show how an IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) instance and related resources are provisioned. As mentioned earlier, you will not be provisioning these resources, rather you will utilize pre-provisioned resources. As mentioned earlier, this scenario may be of interest to only a few individuals in the client's organization and may be skipped if not demonstrating to the technical team that will be responsible for deploying SCC.

Click the Standard pricing plan. Discussion points: SCC provides a trial pricing plan, which allows clients to try SCC at no cost for 30 days. The standard pricing plan is based upon the number of evaluations performed. Clients are charged if an evaluation produces a result of pass or fail. Charges are not incurred for the evaluation if the check cannot be performed or is not applicable. Each scan that is run provides with the number of billable evaluations in the results user interface (UI). More information on SCC pricing can be found here . IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) has a different pricing model. WP is priced hourly based on the number of nodes protected.

Setup the remediation scenario A compelling demonstration of IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) not only includes showing the results of a compliance scan, but also demonstrating how compliance failures can be remediated. In this demonstration guide, you will demonstrate how to remediate a failed compliance scan related to a VSI running in an IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and internet protocol (IP) network spoofing. While IP network spoofing has legitimate business uses, it is also a potential vulnerability. You can learn more about IP address spoofing here . SCC has a predefined control that checks to see if a VSI in a VPC has IP network spoofing enabled and flags those VSI's as non-compliant. This scenario was chosen as it is easy to turn this setting on and off of a VSI and VSI's in VPC are inexpensive resources. In the next steps: provision a VSI instance enable IP network spoofing on the VSI create a SCC attachment that scans for VSIs with IP network spoofing enabled run an initial scan In the actual demonstration section of this demonstration guide, you will show the client the compliance failure related to the VSI you created, remediate the issue, re-run the scan, and show the new, successful compliance results.

To access the instance, you will need to create a reservation an IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment dedicated to this learning plan. There are several advantages of leveraging a pre-provisioned SCC instance including being able to see historical SCC scans of resources that would not be available if a new instance was provisioned. Additionally, since all users of this learning plan utilize the same environment there is a cost savings to IBM. This is a shared environment, and you will have limited access to creating resources. Since this is a shared environment, your IBM Cloud identification (ID) will have limited access. For instance, you will not be able to provision a new SCC instance, but you will be able to create rules and attachments, initiate scans, view the SCC dashboard, etc. Attempts to perform actions you do not have permissions for will result in an error like: Please remember to delete any resources you provision as part of this learning plan!
