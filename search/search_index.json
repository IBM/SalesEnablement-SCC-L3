The IBM Learning Content Development team strives to update these assets on a regular basis.</p> <p>Welcome to the demonstration guide for the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) Level 3 learning plan. In this Level 3 course, learn how to demonstrate IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) and IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Workload Protection (WP) to clients. </p> <p>ACCREDITATION</p> <p>To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various sections of this demonstration guide. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role.</p> <p>Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. Hint: watch for  \"BP Quiz Question\" messages in the demonstration guide.</p> <p>IBMers must develop and record a Stand &amp; Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab.</p> <p>Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand &amp; Deliver recording is provided within the Evaluation Checklist that accompanies the Level 3 course in YourLearning.</p> <p>Before starting this learning plan, it is highly recommended that you complete the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center Foundation learning plan as that base knowledge is assumed for this course. The Level 2 courses can be found here:</p> <ul> <li>IBMers: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-7D82EAEDC78C</li> <li>Business Partners: https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=13363</li> </ul> <p>Another excellent resource is the IBM Technology Patterns for Regulated Cloud workloads. Note: at this time, the Technology Patterns site is only available to IBMers. This website includes use cases, client stories, and other seller enablement. Expand the left hand menu by clicking \"Compliance and Workload Protection\" to see everything on the site. The site includes more assets for demos and labs that are related to SCC. These assets include reservable IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environments. These environments are excellent options for proof-of-concepts, and the like, for custom client engagements. This environment differs from the environment that is used for this learning plan. The ITZ environment for this learning plan utilizes pre-provisioned resources in a shared environment allowing sellers and technical sellers to quickly have access to a demonstration environment without the need for time-consuming provisioning and configuration tasks.</p> <p>Every good client demonstration should tell a story that the client can relate to. This can be a particular pain point the client is experiencing or a common industry scenario. SCC includes both industry specific (for example Financial Services), cross-industry controls, and the ability to build custom controls. When performing an actual client demonstration, sellers should focus on the controls most relevant to the client. Refer to the previously mentioned technology pattern for more information on SCC use cases. Additionally, if you know what IBM Cloud resources the client is already using, validate if those resources can be evaluated by SCC. Find the current list of resources that can be evaluated by SCC here.</p> <p>In addition to the Level 2 training and the Technology Pattern, all sellers and technical sellers are encouraged to read the SCC documentation. The documentation contains a wealth of information that is not covered in the Level 2 or Level 3 training, including topics like:</p> <ul> <li>SCC's underlying architecture. Did you know that SCC is a multi-tenant solution?</li> <li>High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)</li> <li>Protecting SCC resources with context-based restrictions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#key-scc-concepts","title":"Key SCC Concepts","text":"<p>Before continuing, review the following key concepts associated with SCC. Additional details on these and other SCC-related concepts can be found here.</p> <p>Control - A technical, administrative, or physical safeguard that is designed to meet a set of defined security and privacy requirements. Controls exist to prevent, detect, or lessen the ability of a threat to exploit a vulnerability.</p> <p>Specification - A statement that defines the specific security and privacy requirements that a control must meet.</p> <p>Control Library - A collection of predefined or custom controls. Control libraries show all the controls in an account that are available to be evaluated. A library is helpful for organizing and versioning controls. </p> <p>Profile - A group of controls that are related to a specific compliance objective. Although very similar in structure to a control library, a profile can be attached to a set of resources and be evaluated. </p> <p>Assessment - The actual evaluation of a configuration for compliance with applicable standards. An assessment can be either automated or manual depending on the control. </p> <p>Rule - A set of conditional statements that are used to determine whether a resource configuration is in compliance. To evaluate a rule, it must be associated with a profile through an assessment.</p> <p>Parameter - The specific configuration property that is evaluated. Each parameter is assigned a value by default that can be customized when an attachment is created. For example, if a control evaluates which region that a resource exits in, you can specify the region that you want to check for by defining the parameter.</p> <p>Attachment - The connection between a profile and scope that defines the way that SCC conducts an evaluation. An attachment is formed by selecting the grouping of resources to be evaluates and a profile. Then, you specify the parameters that you want to evaluate for. Attachments are evaluated once per day or can be initiated as needed.</p> <p>These concepts can be visualized in these steps:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>A security or compliance focal specifies the controls to be enabled. This is done by selecting a pre-defined profile (for example IBM Cloud Security Best Practices, IBM Cloud for Financial Services, and so on) or creating a custom profile with specific controls. Optionally, the focal might create custom rules.</li> <li>Next, the focal creates an attachment of the profile. The attachment defines the scope of resources to be scanned along with any optional, customized parameters for specific controls.</li> <li>Once saved, the initial scan of the attachment is performed against the scoped resources. Scan's are typically done daily, weekly, or monthly basis, but can also be run ad-hoc.</li> <li>The results of the scan are stored in a IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) specified by the client when the SCC instance is created.</li> <li>Finally, the results are made accessible through the SCC Dashboard in the IBM Cloud Portal.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>Think something is down?

IBM Sales must record a stand and deliver that at a minimum covers the high-level demonstration of SCC flow. IBM Technical Sales must record a stand and deliver that covers at a minimum the high-level demonstration of SCC flow and at least one of the other two flows. Both Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales must pass a short quiz related to the scenarios and environment utilized by these flows.</p> <p>Included with each flow, are step-by-step instructions along with talking points that can be used when delivering a client demonstration. While this demonstration guide is general in nature and not specific to a single client or industry, consider customizing it to a client you are currently working with or plan to work with in the future. Do this by addressing either a client specific pain point or a specific industry regulation that SCC covers (e.g. financial services). Demonstrations should resonate with the individuals in the audience. It is important to know your audience and the roles they have within their company when preparing and delivering your demonstrations. The demonstration steps provided below may not resonate with all user roles. For instance, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) may not be concerned about how to provision an instance for IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC), but members of the CRO's technical staff tasked with doing so will. Some individuals will focus on compliance related to their code development while others will focus on the infrastructure the applications run on in production. When planning a client demonstration focus on the most important aspects of the offering to the audience in attendance and be selective on the aspects of the SCC suite of offerings you choose to show.</p> <p>Additionally, a recording is available for each of the flows. These videos may vary slightly from the documented flows, but they were all recorded using the same ITZ environment which you reserved earlier. To avoid charges to your IBM Cloud account, make sure you switch accounts in the IBM Cloud portal as described earlier.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Several parts of the demonstration script have you stop before clicking a \"create\" or \"submit\" button. This \"baking-show\" approach to demonstrating SCC is used to allow all participants in this learning plan to use the same environment, minimize cost, and avoid lengthy provisioning times of resources. If you do click \"create\" or \"submit\" you will receive an error stating you do not have permissions to perform that action.</p>"},{"location":"demo/provisioning/","title":"Provisioning an SCC instance (OPTIONAL)","text":"<p>In this demonstration flow, you will be using a baking show approach to show how an IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center (SCC) instance and related resources are provisioned.
